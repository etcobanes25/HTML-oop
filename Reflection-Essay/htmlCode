    <h1>Essay: Intro to Web Development</h1>
    <h2>By: Etcobanes Luieme M.</h2>
    <hr>
    <p> When I first learned about HTML, it was very new to me. <br> 
        At first, I thought it was a programming language, but it is not. <br>
        When our instructor introduced HTML to us, I was surprised that it is called a language but not a programming language. <br> 
        I got a little confused at first because I thought all computer languages were used for programming. <br> 
        I also realized that you cannot just type anything in HTML without understanding its logic and structure. </p>

    <p> I found out that even if HTML is not a programming language. <br>
        it is very important because it builds the structure of all web pages, like Facebook, YouTube, Google, or TikTok <br>
        It is like the skeleton of a house without it, the website would not have shape or form. <br>
        I also learned that HTML uses tags to create different parts of a webpage. Each tag has a special job. <br>
        For example, the (p) for paragraph (h) for headings (br) tag is used to break a line, like pressing “Enter” to move text to the next line. <br>
        I understood that writing the tags correctly is very important because even a small mistake can affect how the website looks. <br>
    </p>
    
    <p> Now that I know a little about HTML, I want to create my own webpage in the future. <br>
        I want to learn more about HTML and also study other web technologies like CSS to make my website look more beautiful and creative. <br>
        Learning HTML made me excited to explore more about web development and how websites are built from scratch.
